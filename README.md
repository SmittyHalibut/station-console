# station-console
A station console, to connect an operator, logger, and radio together.

See the `v1-eagle` branch for my first pass at this project from 2015, but note that it
is broken.  I'll be working on a re-do of it in this branch `master` using KiCAD
instead of Eagle, and trying to simplify the circuit a bit, possibly making it modular.
